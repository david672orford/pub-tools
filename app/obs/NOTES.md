## Scripts Embedded in OBS

OBS has embedded Python and Lua interpreters.

* [Python/Lua Scripting](https://obsproject.com/docs/scripting.html)
* [OBS Studio Python Scripting Cheatsheet](https://github.com/upgradeQ/OBS-Studio-Python-Scripting-Cheatsheet-obspython-Examples-of-API#using-classes)
* [Getting Started With OBS Scripting](https://obsproject.com/wiki/Getting-Started-With-OBS-Scripting)

Example Scripts:

* [ObsSoundPlugin](https://github.com/theastropath/ObsSoundPlugin)

## OBS-Websocket

Another way to extend and control OBS is to install the OBS-Websocket module
so that a your script running outside of OBS can send it queries and commands.
