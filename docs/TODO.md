# Pub-Tools TODO

## General

* Why does OBS exit on the exception in khplayer-server.py which occurs when
port 5000 is already in use? Why can't we catch this exception?
* Progress bar when loading weeks
* khplayer-videos.py doesn't seem to work with the poster images
* khplayer-startup.py and khplayer-vidoes.py don't share muting smoothly
