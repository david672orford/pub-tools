# Pub-Tools TODO

## Breakage

* Sometimes only every other or every third scene list update reaches the browser
* Disconnected of OBS no longer detected

## General

* Zoom in a browser source. Worth doing?
* Why does OBS exit on the exception in khplayer-server.py which occurs when
port 5000 is already in use? Why can't we catch this exception?
* Progress bar when loading weeks
* Set timeout image using v4l2loopback. See https://www.doctorojiplatico.com/2012/12/please-stand-by-test-pattern-test-card.html

## Scenes Tab (Long Term)

* Should we cache thumbnail images in the Videos, Books, and PeriodicalIssues objects?
* Drag and drop into our Scenes tab does not work in OBS browser dock (for files, works for URL's)
