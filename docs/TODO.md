# Pub-Tools TODO

## Bugs

* Click on thumbnail in scenes list (sometimes) does nothing.
  (This is likely the case only after a refresh or the thumbnail.)
* Why no thumbnail if slide folder contains only a single video? (See talk â„–90)
* Yeartext slide uses Roboto font which is not necessarily installed on
  Ubuntu. Use fc-list to detect problem.
* Playing video in pywebview requires packages which are not necessarily
  installed in Ubuntu. (See
  https://askubuntu.com/questions/1350001/how-to-use-gstreamer-to-play-an-mp4-video) Required may include: gstreamer1.0-plugins-good gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad gstreamer1.0-plugins-ugly
* Meeting tab current date and weekend/midweek seems to be on GMT
* Exception thrown on expired Jwstream links.
* patchbay glitches:
  * It is possible to drop a node onto an input provoking an error in the javascript console
  * Nodes jump slightly on reload

## Finish Windows Port

* Fallback to running OBS from install location if no shortcut
* Problems with Unicode filenames on Windows when started from khplayer-server.py.
  (See https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.getfilesystemencoding)

## Easy Improvements

* Cancel spotlight in Zoom when Zoom scene becomes active.

## Hard Stuff

* Figure out how to set up logging better:
  * **flask cable** commands call logger.info(), but no output is produced
  * CLI support for enabling debugging per module
* Load Bible verses. Could incorporate [Linkture](https://github.com/erykjj/linkture).
* When the user change the position of a scene by dragging and dropping send
  custom event to the other browsers to they can move it too
* Auto-assign F-keys to scenes and show then in the Scenes tab (may not be supported in OBS-Websocket)
