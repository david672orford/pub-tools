# Pub-Tools TODO

## Bugs

* Click on thumbnail in scenes list (sometimes) does nothing.
  (This is likely the case only after a refresh or the thumbnail.)
* Why no thumbnail if slide folder contains only a single video? (See talk â„–90)
* Straighten out the downloading of PDF thumbnails from Gdrive
* patchbay: it is possible to drop a node onto an input provoking an error in the javascript console
* filesytemencoding problems when started from khplayer-server.py (See https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.getfilesystemencoding)
* Some Gdrive sharing URL's not acceptable for pulling JW Stream URL lists?

## Easy Improvements

* Listen address and port setting in khplayer-server.py
* Verify cache cleaning policy and file categorization
* Add cleaners for gdrive-cache and flask-cache
* Progress bar for Gdrive downloads. This will require knowing the file size. (may already be done)

## Hard Stuff

* Figure out to set up logging better:
  * **flask cable** commands call logger.info(), but no output is produced
  * CLI support for enabling debugging per module
* Incorporate [Linkture](https://github.com/erykjj/linkture)
* Send scene reorder events to other (all) browsers
* Auto-assign F-keys to scenes and show then in the Scenes tab (may not be supported in OBS-Websocket)
