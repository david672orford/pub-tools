## The KH Player Subapp

This is the most well-developed of the modules. It helps you to load the videos
and illustrations for a congregation meeting into OBS Studio ready to play.

This note describes how to set up OBS to play the videos at meetings while
some participants are connected by Zoom. These instructions apply to Ubuntu
Linux 22.04.

## Install OBS Studio

On Ubuntu:

    $ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:obsproject/obs-studio
    $ sudo apt install obs-studio

On Microsoft Windows:

    > winget install --id=OBSProject.OBSStudio -e

The KH Player module communicates with OBS over a websocket. You will need to use
OBS version 2.8 or later. Enable the websocket plugin in **Tools** â†’
**Websocket Server Settings**. If KH Player cannot find your OBS configuration
to get the websocket port and password, set OBS\_WEBSOCKET in config.py
using the example in sample-config.py.

## Test Run

Start the Pub-Tools web server:

    $ ./start.py

Then open this URL in a web browser:

    http://localhost:5000/khplayer/

A window will appear with tabs such as **Meetings**, **Songs**,
and **Videos** which can be used to load videos material into OBS.

## Install Pipewire

Install the new audio subsystem called Pipewire following the instructions
in the document [Pipewire on Debian](https://pipewire-debian.github.io/pipewire-debian/).
Be sure to follow the part about installing Wireplumber. If you are running Ubuntu 24.04
or later, then Pipewire may already be installed.

## Set Up Video Loopback Device

    $ ./docs/setup-loopback.sh

## Initial Setup of Zoom

* Under **General** enable **Use dual monitors**.
* Under **Video** select **Original ratio** and **HD**. Turn off **Mirror my video**.
* Still under **Video** choose **See myself as the active speaker while speaking**.
* Under **Audio** set **Suppress background noise** to **Low** so that music will not be muted.

## Initial Setup of OBS

* In the settings under **General** find **Projectors** and check the boxes next to
  **Make projectors always on top** and **Limit one fullscreen projector per screen**.
* In the settings under **Audio** set the **Monitoring Device** to **Monitor of To-Zoom**.
* In the settings under **Video** set the **Base (Canvas) Resolution** and **Output (Scaled) Resolution** to 1024x720.
* TODO: Setting to prevent warning about exit with virtual camera running
* Under **Tools** find the OBS-Websocket plugin and enable it
* Under **Docks** uncheck **Audio Mixer** since we will not be using it.
* Go to **Tools**, **Scripts** and add the following scripts from the **obs-scripts**
directory of this project:
  * **khplayer-server.py** -- Run the Pub-Tools web server inside of OBS so we will not need
  * **khplayer-cable.py** -- Creates a To-Zoom/From-OBS virtual audio cable every time OBS starts
  * **khplayer-automate.py** -- Simplify startup and playing of vidoes
    * At Startup:
      * Start a fullscreen output on the monitor you select
      * Start the virtual camera
      * Switch to the yeartext scene you have selected
    * Mute the microphone whenever the yeartext scene is displayed
    * When a Video is played:
      * Mute the microphone. This improves sound quality for participant in Zoom considerably.
      * Stop the playing of videos from JW.ORG a few seconds before the end so the speaker will not have to wait for the end card to disappear.
      * Return to the state scene you specify whenever a video finishes playing.
