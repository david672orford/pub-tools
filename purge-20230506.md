# Purge on 6 May 2023

In this file we list the obsolete files which were purged from this project
on 6 May 2023. The commit just before the purge is tagged purge-20230506.

# bin/pw-view-patchbay

This one-line script invokes commands to generate a Dot file of the
Pipewire patchbay and display it. It is obsolete because this project
now includes a patchbay editor.

# obs-scripts/obs-to-zoom.py

This file and the accompanying files in obs-scripts/obs2zoom/ are a utility
which connects to the OBS Websocket plugin and listens to events to determine
when media is playing. When media is playing, it uses remote control to enable
screen sharing (or more precisely sharing of the second camera) in Zoom. When
media playback ends, media sharing in Zoom is stopped.

This script is obsolete for two reasons. One is that we have found that using
the virtual camera is a much better way to play vidoes in Zoom since it is
both simpler and more reliable and it does not force attendees who prefer
gallery view to see the video fullscreen.

The second reason this utility is obsolete is that it requires version
4.x of the OBS Websocket plugin. If we were to continue to maintain this
utility, we would have to upgrade it to use the current 5.x plugin and the
effort does not seem justified at this time.

# bin/start-meeting

This script creates the virtual audio cable and launches Zoom. It then
reads configuration from the **ZOOM** dictionary in instance/config.py,
logs in, and starts the meeting.

We have decided to retire this script for the following reasons:

* It breaks when changes are made to the Zoom UI
* It fails miserably if the keyboard layout is not English
* It works only on Linux
* We have discovered that most of what it does can be accomplished by
  putting an appropriate Zoom command line in the application launcher

We are also removing the code for invoking this function from KH Player.
To do this we are deleting code from the following files:

* app/subapps/khplayer/templates/khplayer/actions.html
* app/subapps/khplayer/templates/khplayer/config.html
* app/subapps/khplayer/view\_actions.py
* app/subapps/khplayer/view\_config.py
* app/subapps/khplayer/zoom.py

# Start OBS

We are removing the code to start OBS from within KH Player. Instead we will
be starting KH Player from within OBS. We will be removing code from the
following files:

* app/subapps/khplayer/templates/khplayer/actions.html
* app/subapps/khplayer/view\_actions.py
